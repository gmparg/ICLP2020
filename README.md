### Supplementary Material

**encodings**
* RCC5-GEN-0-10.asp:	      GEN-0 encoding for RCC-5, including input of 10 regions
* RCC5-GEN-1-10.asp:	      GEN-1 encoding for RCC-5, including input of 10 regions
* RCC5-GEN-2-10.asp:	      GEN-2 encoding for RCC-5, including input of 10 regions
* RCC5-GEN-3-10.asp:	      GEN-3 encoding for RCC-5 (with Python custom propagation code), including input of 10 regions

**GQR2ASP Converter**:             Prototype converter tool that generates GEN-* encodings (without input data) from GQR calculus definition files

**los_angeles5g.csv**:     Dataset used in the experiments, containing relations between coverage regions of antennas in Los Angeles county, assuming high-band 5G

**CSV2ASPConverterGEN.java**:             Java code used for the experiments, that generates GEN-* encodings using data from the LA county dataset

**CSV2GQR.java**:             Java code used for the experiments, that generates input in the format accepted by GQR using data from the LA county dataset

**CSV2SparQ.java**:             Java code used for the experiments, that generates input in the format accepted by SparQ using data from the LA county dataset
